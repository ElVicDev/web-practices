    <p>Update and save the file again, this time as

    <p>Add one more variable called "adjective" and
        assign it a value that describes you. Use the
        console to display a sentence that includes all
        three variables. This time use a template
        literal (tick marks, and ${} around variables).</p>

    <script>
        var firstName = "Vicente";
        var lastName = "Escobar";
        var adjective = "smart"
        console.log(`My name is ${firstName} ${lastName} and I consider that I am ${adjective}`);
    </script>
