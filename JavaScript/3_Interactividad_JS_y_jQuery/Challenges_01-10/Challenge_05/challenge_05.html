    <h1>Challenge 5</h1>

	<h2>Adding a greeting function.</h2>
	
	<p>Add an additional property to the pet object called “greeting” 
        that contains a function as its value.</p>
    <p>The function should alert the greeting that the pet says 
        or does when you arrive home.</p>
    <p>Remember that when an object has a function, it is called a method.</p>
    <p>Make a call to the pet greeting method and also console log 
        the whole pet object so you can see everything you have added to it.</p>
